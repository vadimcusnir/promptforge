# Section 1: The Forge (Hero Section)

## Philosophy
The Hero section is not just an introductionâ€”it is the **first ritual**. Users must immediately understand they have entered a sacred space of creation, not a casual tool.

## Visual Hierarchy

### Primary Elements
1. **Brand Identity**
   - Logo: Stylized forge hammer + neural network (top left)
   - Tagline: "WHERE THOUGHTS BECOME ARTIFACTS"

2. **Value Proposition**
   - Main headline: "FORGE PROMPTS THAT MATTER"
   - Subheadline: "Transform vague ideas into precise instructions. Master the art of AI communication."

3. **The Central Forge**
   - Large, terminal-style input field
   - Placeholder: "PROMPT-FORGE: _"
   - Real-time character count and complexity analysis
   - Submit button: "TRANSMUTE"

### Background Layer System
Based on the real implementation analysis, the background must be more **structured and purposeful**:

#### Layer 0: Grid Foundation
- Subtle geometric grid (inspired by circuit boards)
- Responsive to screen size
- Provides visual structure without distraction

#### Layer 1: Data Streams
- Flowing text tokens (AI terminology, philosophical concepts)
- Speed and density vary by system state
- Color-coded by category (green=technical, orange=creative, blue=analytical)

#### Layer 2: Geometric Figures
- Abstract representations of neural networks
- Lines connecting nodes, forming and dissolving
- Mathematical beauty in motion

#### Layer 3: Wisdom Layer
- Occasional philosophical quotes
- Appears contextually based on user behavior
- Typography-focused, high impact

## State-Responsive Behavior

### DORMANT State
- Minimal animation, low energy
- Grid barely visible
- Few tokens moving slowly
- No geometric activity
- Interface dimmed but present

### AWAKENING State (User Arrives)
- Grid lines illuminate progressively
- Tokens begin flowing more rapidly
- Geometric patterns start forming
- Interface brightens
- Transition duration: 2-3 seconds

### ACTIVE State (Default)
- All layers at balanced activity
- Smooth, hypnotic motion
- Interface fully bright and responsive
- Background provides context without distraction

### FOCUSED State (User Typing)
- Background layers dim significantly
- Grid remains for structure
- Tokens slow to minimal speed
- No geometric distractions
- Full focus on input field

### TRANSMUTING State (Processing)
- High-intensity activity across all layers
- Rapid token movement
- Complex geometric formations
- Progress indication through visual intensity
- Builds anticipation for result

### REVELATION State (Result Display)
- Background settles to calm state
- Result appears with ceremonial presentation
- Geometric frame around output
- Narrative layer provides context

## Interactive Elements

### The Input Field
- Terminal aesthetic with monospace font
- Real-time analysis sidebar:
  - Character count
  - Complexity score
  - Clarity rating
  - Suggested improvements

### Smart Assistance
- Contextual suggestions appear as user types
- Template recommendations based on input patterns
- Auto-completion for common prompt structures
- Syntax highlighting for prompt elements

### Output Presentation
- Results appear in a "artifact frame"
- Clean typography with proper hierarchy
- Copy/share/refine options
- Quality rating system

## Responsive Design

### Desktop (1200px+)
- Full background layer system
- Large input field (60% width)
- Sidebar with advanced controls
- Maximum visual impact

### Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- Simplified background layers
- Adjusted input field size
- Condensed sidebar
- Maintained aesthetic integrity

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Minimal background animation
- Full-width input field
- Collapsed advanced features
- Focus on core functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Critical Metrics
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Input responsiveness: < 50ms
- Animation frame rate: Consistent 60fps

### Optimization Strategies
- CSS-only animations for grid and simple elements
- WebGL for complex particle systems
- Intersection Observer for viewport-based optimizations
- Service Worker for instant subsequent loads

## Accessibility Features

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- Alternative text for visual elements
- Skip links for navigation

### Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility
- Logical tab order
- Visible focus indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Reduced Motion Support
- Automatic detection of `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Fallback to static, high-contrast version
- Maintained functionality without animation
- Clear visual hierarchy in static mode

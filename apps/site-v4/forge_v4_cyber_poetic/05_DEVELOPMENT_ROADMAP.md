# Development Roadmap: The Path to Launch

## Philosophy: From Blueprint to Reality

This roadmap is a pragmatic, 16-week plan to bring the Prompt-Forge™ ecosystem to life. It is structured in four distinct phases, each focusing on a critical stage of development, from building the foundational core to preparing for a successful public launch. We will balance our deep philosophical vision with agile development practices to deliver a world-class platform.

## Phase 1: The Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: To build and launch a functional, beautiful Minimum Viable Product (MVP) centered around The Forge.

- **Week 1: Project Scaffolding & Architecture**
  - **Tasks**: Set up Next.js project, configure Tailwind CSS with the Cyber-Poetic theme, establish state management with Zustand, configure database and authentication providers (Supabase/Stripe), and set up CI/CD pipeline on Vercel.
  - **Deliverable**: A live, deployable skeleton application.

- **Week 2: The Background & State Machine**
  - **Tasks**: Develop the multi-layered `BackgroundVessel` component with its various states (Dormant, Focused, Transmuting). Implement the global state machine that controls the UI's mood and animations.
  - **Deliverable**: A visually alive interface that responds to user presence and state changes.

- **Week 3: The Forge - Frontend**
  - **Tasks**: Build the complete user interface for The Forge, including the central input, real-time analysis sidebar, and control panel. Implement all client-side animations and interactions.
  - **Deliverable**: A fully interactive, client-side Forge experience.

- **Week 4: The Forge - Backend & Launch MVP**
  - **Tasks**: Develop the `/api/forge` endpoint, integrate with a primary AI model (e.g., OpenAI), implement the output display, and conduct thorough testing. Prepare for a limited, invite-only alpha launch.
  - **Deliverable**: A fully functional MVP of The Forge, ready for initial user feedback.

## Phase 2: The Ecosystem Expansion (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal**: To build out the core platform features: The Library and user accounts.

- **Week 5: User Authentication & Profiles**
  - **Tasks**: Implement user registration, login, and profile management using NextAuth.js. Create the database schema for users and their associated data.
  - **Deliverable**: Secure user accounts and personalized user sessions.

- **Week 6: The Library - Backend & Data Model**
  - **Tasks**: Design and implement the database schema for the prompt library, including templates, categories, tags, ratings, and user collections. Develop the necessary API endpoints for CRUD operations.
  - **Deliverable**: A robust backend for managing the prompt library.

- **Week 7: The Library - Frontend**
  - **Tasks**: Build the user interface for The Library, including the grid view, search and filtering functionality, and the detailed view for individual templates.
  - **Deliverable**: A fully interactive and searchable Prompt Library.

- **Week 8: Payment Integration & Subscriptions**
  - **Tasks**: Integrate Stripe to handle subscriptions for the "Craftsman" tier. Implement the logic for gating premium features and content.
  - **Deliverable**: A fully functional payment and subscription system.

## Phase 3: The Path to Mastery (Weeks 9-12)

**Goal**: To build the features that drive user growth and mastery: The Academy and The Dashboard.

- **Week 9: The Academy - Structure & Content**
  - **Tasks**: Design the data model for courses, lessons, and user progress. Develop the backend APIs and begin creating the content for the foundational courses.
  - **Deliverable**: A content management system for The Academy.

- **Week 10: The Academy - Frontend**
  - **Tasks**: Build the user interface for The Academy, allowing users to browse courses, view lessons, and track their progress.
  - **Deliverable**: A complete learning management system within the platform.

- **Week 11: The Dashboard - Analytics & Visualization**
  - **Tasks**: Implement the backend analytics to track user activity, prompt quality, and progress over time. Design and build the data visualizations for the personal dashboard.
  - **Deliverable**: A personal analytics dashboard that makes user growth tangible.

- **Week 12: Community Features - The Guild**
  - **Tasks**: Implement the foundational features for The Guild, including user profiles, a simple forum for discussions, and the ability to share prompts.
  - **Deliverable**: A basic community space to foster user interaction.

## Phase 4: Scale & Launch (Weeks 13-16)

**Goal**: To prepare the platform for a full public launch and future growth.

- **Week 13: Enterprise Features & Team Management**
  - **Tasks**: Develop the core features for the "Master" tier, including team creation, user invitations, and shared team libraries.
  - **Deliverable**: An MVP of the enterprise feature set.

- **Week 14: The Marketplace & API**
  - **Tasks**: Build the functionality for the template marketplace, including submission and review workflows. Begin development of the public API for integrations.
  - **Deliverable**: A system for user-generated content and the foundation for a developer ecosystem.

- **Week 15: Performance Optimization & Security Audit**
  - **Tasks**: Conduct a full performance audit, optimizing database queries, frontend load times, and animation performance. Perform a third-party security audit to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
  - **Deliverable**: A fast, scalable, and secure platform.

- **Week 16: Public Launch & Marketing**
  - **Tasks**: Finalize all marketing materials, prepare the launch campaign (e.g., on Product Hunt), and execute the public launch. Monitor system performance and user feedback closely.

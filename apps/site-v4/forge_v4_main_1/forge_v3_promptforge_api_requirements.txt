## PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:
1. **CRITICAL (Week 1)**: Supabase, Stripe, JWT Secret, Basic Email
2. **HIGH (Week 2)**: Analytics, Sentry, OpenAI, Domain
3. **MEDIUM (Week 3)**: HubSpot, Marketing automation, Advanced email
4. **LOW (Week 4)**: PayPal, Advanced monitoring, Backup automation

## FALLBACK STRATEGY:
If any integration is blocked, implement mock/placeholder functionality to continue development, then replace with real integration when credentials are available.

## SECURITY NOTES:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Monitor API usage and set up alerts for unusual activity

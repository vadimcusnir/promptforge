# 🚀 P0 Launch Deployment Strategy

## 🎯 Goal
Deploy PromptForge™ v3 to production with basic functionality and coming-soon gate active.

## 🔍 Current Issue
Multiple API routes are failing during build due to environment variable validation at module load time. The Supabase URL is being treated as a JWT token, causing "Invalid URL" errors.

## 💡 Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Deployment (Current)
- ✅ **Core Site**: Coming-soon page, basic pages, middleware
- ✅ **Essential APIs**: Toggle coming-soon, basic functionality
- ⚠️ **Advanced APIs**: Temporarily disabled (billing, monitoring, etc.)

### Phase 2: Gradual API Re-enablement (Post-Launch)
- 🔧 **Fix Environment Variables**: Proper Supabase/Stripe configuration
- 🔧 **Re-enable APIs**: Billing, monitoring, advanced features
- 🔧 **Full Functionality**: Complete prompt engineering suite

## 🚀 Immediate Deployment Options

### Option A: Deploy with Disabled APIs (Recommended for P0)
- **Pros**: Fast deployment, core functionality works
- **Cons**: Limited API functionality during launch
- **Timeline**: Immediate deployment possible

### Option B: Fix All APIs First (Not recommended for P0)
- **Pros**: Full functionality from day one
- **Cons**: Delays launch, complex debugging required
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days minimum

## 🎯 P0 Launch Requirements Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Coming-Soon Gate** | ✅ Ready | Middleware working, environment variable set |
| **Basic Pages** | ✅ Ready | All 45 pages compiling successfully |
| **Core Layout** | ✅ Ready | Header, footer, navigation working |
| **SEO & A11y** | ✅ Ready | Robots, sitemap, accessibility features |
| **Advanced APIs** | ⚠️ Disabled | Billing, monitoring, export routes disabled |
| **Build Process** | ✅ Working | Local builds successful |

## 🚀 Recommended Action

**Deploy immediately with Option A** - the core P0 functionality is ready and working. The coming-soon gate will provide the traffic control needed for a safe launch, while the disabled APIs can be re-enabled gradually after launch.

## 📋 Post-Launch Tasks

1. **Week 1**: Fix environment variable configuration
2. **Week 2**: Re-enable billing and monitoring APIs
3. **Week 3**: Re-enable advanced export and execution APIs
4. **Week 4**: Full functionality restoration

## 🎉 Launch Declaration

**PromptForge™ v3 P0 is READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** with the coming-soon gate strategy. The core site functionality meets all P0 requirements and can be deployed safely.

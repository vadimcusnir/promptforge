üß± SCALE PARAMETER ‚Äì ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT NOMENCLATURE

This parameter defines how large, mature, or complex the entity is that will apply the prompt. It directly influences the language, implementation scope, required KPIs, and formatting precision.

‚úÖ CORE SCALE TIERS (7 Total)
#	Scale Tier	Description
1	Personal Brand	Individual experts, creators, coaches, freelancers operating solo
2	Solo Business	One-person company or independent consultant with productized services

üß© EACH SCALE CONTROLS:
Parameter	Effect on Prompt
Output granularity	High for enterprise, low for personal brand
Tone of voice	Conversational for solo, formal/institutional for corporate
System dependencies	Solo = lightweight, Enterprise = must include APIs, workflows
Compliance/guardrails	More intense for larger orgs
Implementation path	Solo = direct execution, Corporate = delegation layers
üì¶ FORMAT LOGIC BY SCALE
üîπ 1. Personal Brand

Use metaphors, rhetorical hooks

Prompt output is lightweight (text, PDF)

KPI = visibility, resonance, engagement

Examples: ‚ÄúPosition your story‚Äù, ‚ÄúAuthority carousel‚Äù

üîπ 2. Solo Business

Add structure: SOPs, checklists

Still fast to implement

KPI = time-to-execute, clarity, conversion rate

Prompt example: ‚ÄúLead Gen SOP + auto-responder in Notion‚Äù

üîπ 3. Startup

Prompt must include edge-case handling

Format = .md, .json, .airtable, .notion, .zapier blueprint

KPI = growth, velocity, ops clarity

Guardrails: MVP-friendly, but scale-aware

üîπ 4. Boutique Agency

Prompt includes multi-client use

Output format = repeatable templates

KPI = team adoption, template reuse rate

Prompt: ‚ÄúScalable content workflow across 5 clients‚Äù

üîπ 5. SMB

SOPs must be formalized, include reporting

Format: .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .json

KPI = cost per task, repeatability

Guardrails: clearer compliance

üîπ 6. Corporate

Language must be precise, depersonalized

Prompt includes approval process, data security clauses

Format: .json, .csv, .ics, .yaml

KPI = alignment, internal adoption, system readiness

üîπ 7. Enterprise

Prompt must be modular, API-integrated

Includes stakeholders, roles, escalation paths

Format: multi-artifact export + telemetry logging

KPI = resilience, observability, failover planning

üìê SCHEMA FORMAT (for internal logic)
{
  "scale": "Startup",
  "output_format": "md + json",
  "tone": "agile, tactical",
  "dependencies": ["Notion", "Zapier"],
  "kpi_bias": ["execution speed", "clarity", "scalability"],
  "risk_tolerance": "medium",
  "guardrails": ["must include fallback", "no hard compliance required"]
}

üß† Strategic Use of scale

Every prompt generated through PROMPTFORGE adapts its:

structure

style

format

risk profile

stakeholder complexity

Example: Same SOP generated for Personal Brand vs Enterprise ‚Üí completely different execution plan, tone, and constraints.

‚úÖ Verdict

The Scale parameter turns each prompt from a generic template into a context-aware execution artifact.
It ensures every output is deployable, realistic, and psychologically calibrated to the decision-making power and resources of the operator.










‚ö°Ô∏è URGENCY PARAMETER ‚Äì EXECUTION PRESSURE NOMENCLATURE

The urgency parameter defines how fast the outcome of the prompt must be implemented. It influences the scope, format, fallback logic, decision aggressiveness, and the level of abstraction vs action in the generated output.

‚úÖ STANDARD URGENCY LEVELS (5 total)
#	Urgency Tier	Description
1	Low	No immediate pressure; prompts are exploratory or strategic
2	Planned	Scheduled execution within a normal cycle (2‚Äì6 weeks)
3	Sprint	Fast delivery needed (3‚Äì7 days); tactical and focused
4	Pilot	Rapid prototyping, small-scale live execution, learn fast
5	Crisis	Immediate deployment needed; risk mitigation, failover, or public response
üß© EACH URGENCY LEVEL AFFECTS:
Aspect	Behavior
Output structure	Low urgency = strategic planning, Crisis = direct commands
Fallback logic	Pilot/Crisis require automatic alternatives
Tone	Low = analytical, Sprint = energetic, Crisis = assertive, binary
Artifacts format	Crisis = .txt + .json + alert.md, Sprint = .checklist + .md
Time-to-implement	Enforced deadlines injected into the prompt logic
Risk tolerance	High urgency tolerates imperfect data, but needs action now
üì¶ URGENCY SCENARIOS
üîπ 1. Low

Tone: reflective, visionary

Prompt style: exploratory frameworks, latent maps

KPIs: long-term clarity, alignment, idea density

Use case: thought leadership, knowledge architecture, research module

üîπ 2. Planned

Tone: balanced, instructional

Prompt style: planning prompts, calendarized SOPs

KPIs: execution by date, team readiness

Use case: GTD prompts, onboarding series, launch prep

üîπ 3. Sprint

Tone: precise, no fluff

Prompt style: checklists, short-loop workflows

KPIs: execution time, click-to-output, minimal blockers

Use case: quick campaign, feature rollout, weekly deliverables

üîπ 4. Pilot

Tone: experimental, lean, proactive

Prompt style: first-version SOPs, MVP flows

KPIs: error detection, hypothesis validation, iteration loop

Use case: rapid deployment of an idea into testable action

üîπ 5. Crisis

üìê SCHEMA FORMAT (for internal use)
{
  "urgency": "Crisis",
  "tone": "assertive",
  "kpi_focus": ["time_to_action", "containment_rate"],
  "output_format": ["checklist", "markdown", "json"],
  "fallback_required": true,
  "deadline": "24h",
  "guardrails": ["no ambiguity", "include escalation path"]
}

üéØ Strategic Importance of urgency

Controls how GPT structures output

Decides what level of abstraction vs action is used

Forces scope compression and linguistic tension into the prompt

For example:

A "Risk & Trust Reversal" prompt with urgency: crisis will auto-generate hard guarantees, disclaimers, refund logic, and psychological safety messaging ‚Äî while urgency: planned will focus on A/B testability, stakeholder alignment, and opt-in frameworks.

‚úÖ Verdict

Urgency is not about speed.
It‚Äôs about pressure calibration and operational tension in decision-making.
This parameter ensures that every prompt knows not just what to deliver ‚Äî but when, how hard, and with what level of compromise.

# Overview

PromptForge™ v3 is a comprehensive prompt engineering platform that enables you to create, test, and deploy high-quality prompts at scale. Built on the 7D framework, it provides structured parameters for consistent and effective prompt engineering.

## What is PromptForge™ v3?

PromptForge™ v3 is designed to solve the challenges of prompt engineering at scale:

- **Consistency**: The 7D framework ensures all prompts follow a structured approach
- **Quality**: Built-in testing and validation ensures high-quality outputs
- **Scalability**: API-first design allows integration into any workflow
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple output formats and deployment options

## Core Concepts

### 7D Framework

The 7D framework provides seven key dimensions for prompt engineering:

1. **Domain**: The specific field or industry context
2. **Scale**: The scope and complexity of the task
3. **Urgency**: The time sensitivity of the output
4. **Complexity**: The technical difficulty level
5. **Resources**: Available computational and human resources
6. **Application**: The intended use case or deployment scenario
7. **Output**: The desired format and structure of results

### Modules

PromptForge™ v3 organizes functionality into specialized modules:

- **M001**: Content Optimization
- **M002**: Technical Documentation
- **M003**: Marketing Copy Generator
- **M004**: Code Review Assistant
- **M005**: Data Analysis Prompts

Each module is designed for specific use cases and includes optimized prompts, validation rules, and output formatting.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Module**: Select the module that best fits your use case
2. **Configure Parameters**: Set up the 7D parameters for your specific needs
3. **Test and Validate**: Use the built-in testing engine to validate your prompts
4. **Deploy**: Export your prompts in the desired format or integrate via API

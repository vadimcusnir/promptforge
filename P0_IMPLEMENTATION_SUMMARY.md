# P0 Site Hardening Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented the complete P0 pre-launch layer for PromptForge™ v3, enabling safe traffic gating, stable UX, and a crawlable, accessible site tree before enabling GPT live functionality.

## ✅ Completed Requirements

### A) Coming-Soon Hard Gate ✅
- **Middleware Implementation**: Created `middleware.ts` that hard-redirects all routes to `/coming-soon` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMING_SOON=true`
- **Allowlist**: Configured proper allowlist for `/coming-soon`, `/thankyou`, `/api/*`, and static assets
- **Coming-Soon Page**: Implemented spec-compliant page with:
  - Dark glass design with fixed two-layer background
  - Single CTA "Join the Waitlist"
  - Proof-bar (TTA<60s | Score≥80 | Export .md/.json/.pdf)
  - Industrial theme with proper styling
- **Admin Toggle**: Created `/api/toggle-coming-soon` endpoint with admin-only access

### B) Site-Tree MVP ✅
- **Core Pages**: All required pages exist and render without runtime errors:
  - `/docs` - Documentation hub with search and navigation
  - `/guides` - Interactive learning guides with progress tracking
  - `/about` - Company information with industrial theme
  - `/contact` - Contact form with enterprise styling
  - `/privacy` - Privacy policy with glass card design
  - `/terms` - Terms of service with comprehensive coverage
  - `/404` - Custom not-found page
  - `/pricing`, `/modules`, `/generator`, `/dashboard` - Scaffolded pages
- **Layout Consistency**: Header/footer shared via `app/layout.tsx` with no duplicates

### C) SEO & OG Basics ✅
- **Robots.txt**: Created `app/robots.ts` with proper disallow rules for internal routes
- **Sitemap**: Updated `app/sitemap.ts` with canonical routes and proper priorities
- **Metadata**: Enhanced `app/layout.tsx` with:
  - Proper title, description, and keywords
  - OpenGraph and Twitter card support
  - Canonical URL configuration
  - OG image placeholder (`/og/default.webp`)

### D) Accessibility & UX Hardening ✅
- **Global Focus Styles**: Implemented consistent focus rings with `:focus-visible`
- **Skip Link**: Added "Skip to main content" functionality
- **ARIA Support**: Proper `aria-current` and semantic structure
- **Motion Reduction**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` preferences
- **CLS Prevention**: Single fixed background mounted at layout level
- **Font Optimization**: Preload fonts with `font-display: swap`
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast mode preferences

### E) Generator Stability & Local History ✅
- **SSR/Client Sync**: Fixed for `/generator` page
- **Run ID Generation**: SHA-256 based run identification
- **Local Storage**: Persistence to localStorage for history
- **Dashboard Integration**: Basic filters and local mode support
- **Mocked GPT**: Keeps GPT calls mocked while Coming-Soon is active

## 🎨 Design Implementation

### Glass/Glow Tokens
- `.glass-card` - Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur
- `.glass-panel` - Advanced glass panels with enhanced shadows
- `.glow-border` - Glowing border effects
- `.glow-text` - Text shadow effects

### Anti-CLS & Performance
- Fixed background positioning to prevent duplicate mounting
- Aspect ratio reservations for content
- Font preloading optimization
- Motion reduction support
- Custom scrollbar styling for dark theme

### Color Scheme
- Dark theme with gold accent (#d1a954)
- Proper contrast ratios (≥4.5:1)
- Consistent color tokens throughout
- High contrast mode support

```

### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMING_SOON=true` - Enables coming-soon mode
- `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` - Required for toggle endpoint access

### Middleware Configuration
- Hard redirects all routes to `/coming-soon` when enabled
- Proper allowlist for essential routes and static assets
- Static file handling for images, fonts, and other assets

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Functionality Tests ✅
- Coming-soon gate: Working redirect (307 status)
- Coming-soon page: Accessible (200 status)
- All required pages: Exist and compile
- Middleware: Proper environment variable handling
- Admin endpoint: Authentication and authorization implemented

### Code Quality ✅
- TypeScript compilation: Core functionality passes
- ESLint: Basic linting passes (some API route warnings)
- File structure: All required files present
- Import/export: No critical dependency issues

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### API Route Type Errors
- Export bundle route has TypeScript type mismatches
- These don't affect the P0 core functionality
- Can be addressed in subsequent iterations

### Build Warnings
- ESLint plugin configuration warnings
- Module type warnings (non-critical)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (P0 Complete)
1. ✅ Coming-soon gate functional
2. ✅ All required pages implemented
3. ✅ SEO and accessibility implemented
4. ✅ Basic site tree operational

### Phase 1 (Post-P0)
1. Fix API route type errors
2. Implement proper GPT integration
3. Add comprehensive testing suite
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 2 (Production Ready)
1. Lighthouse optimization (target ≥90)
2. Comprehensive accessibility audit
3. Performance monitoring
4. Security hardening
